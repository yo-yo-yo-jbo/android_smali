# Android - patching Apps
One think you sometimes like to do is patching Apps - you can do that dynamically using tools like [Frida](https://github.com/frida/frida).  
Dynamic instrumentation is excellent but has strong requirements (often requires rooting your phone), so one thing one could do is patch Apps statically.  
Of course, if you want to patch native code (called via JNI) you can easily patch the `*.so` files in the App and repackage, but how do you patch the Java bytecode?  
For that, we'll introduce how Java Apps bytecode looks like, how to patch it, repackage the App etc., without rooting your phone.

## Tooling
There are many tools out there, but my favorite is probably [apktool](https://apktool.org).
